# CHDL
Course Hero File Downloader. Free.

![](https://puu.sh/mnFsH/d2b9af6b23.png)

This script was hastily concocted. CHDL is a Chrome Extension that attempts to download full (unblurred) documents from Course Hero.

## Installation
-First, go to chrome://extensions/

-Then, in the top-right hand corner, turn on 'Developer Mode'

-Once youve extracted the repositories folder, click on the 'load unpacked' option and select the 'Min' file

-Profit

## Usage
You must signed in and viewing a document on CourseHero to use the extension, you can activate it from either the toolbar or the right-click context menu.

The extension works due to a weird permission error on CourseHero's end that fails to check what files users should be able to access.

Singular file downloads seem to have a very high success rate when the entire document is shown (even if most pages are blurred).

Try out the "Download all files from this course." option to start downloading relevant files - it shouldn't be more than a handful.
